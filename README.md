# restricted-shell

Like many of my repos, this is a work-in-progress.

The idea is to create a shell interpreter that is easy to lock down and prevent it from doing harm. The codebase requires the Python version of [Piraha](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrbrandt/piraha-peg/master/py/Piraha.py).

It is not an attempt to match the full functionality and semantics of bash (probably too hard to be worth it).

Better instructions will be posted as the code is cleaned up.
